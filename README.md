## Introduction
Taxis have been a vital mode of transportation for decades, serving millions of passengers daily across different locations, from urban centers to quieter suburban areas. As cities grow and mobility patterns evolve, understanding how various factors influence taxi operations and revenue has become more critical than ever.

In this presentation, we will explore the key elements that shape taxi performance, including location, trip frequency, traffic conditions, weather patterns, and customer behavior. By analyzing these factors, we can uncover patterns that help improve operational efficiency, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance overall service quality.

Through data-driven insights and visualizations, this analysis aims to provide a clearer understanding of what drives taxi revenue, how different locations impact demand, and how external factors such as peak hours and payment methods influence profitability.

By the end of this Presentation, we will have a comprehensive view of the trends shaping the taxi industry and actionable recommendations to enhance service efficiency and revenue growth.

## Background Study
### The Evolution of Taxi Services
Taxis have been a fundamental mode of transportation for decades, offering a flexible alternative to public transport. Public transport is designed to be accessible to everyone, providing a more affordable and sustainable option for getting around. Historically, taxi services have adapted to urban expansion, technological advancements, and changing consumer preferences. From the introduction of metered fares to the integration of digital payment systems, the industry has continuously evolved to enhance convenience and efficiency.

### Factors Influencing Taxi Operations
The performance and demand for taxi services depend on several factors, including location, traffic conditions, trip purpose, customer behavior, and external influences like weather. These elements shape how and when taxis are used, affecting overall service efficiency.

### Understanding the Five Key Locations
**Uptown**
- Bustling commercial and residential area.
- Business centers, shopping districts, entertainment venues.
- Mix of work-related trips, errands, and social outings.

**Midtown**
- Central hub with office buildings, hotels, and transportation links.
- Heavy traffic due to high commuter density.
- Peak demand during rush hours.

**Airport**
- Major transit point for travelers, tourists, and professionals.
- High-value fares linked to flight schedules.

**Downtown**
- Dense residential and commercial activity.
- Government offices, landmarks, nightlife.
- High trip volume with diverse trip purposes.

**Suburbs**
- Predominantly residential, lower population density.
- Longer trips, different demand patterns.

### Other Key Factors Affecting Taxi Demand
- **Traffic Conditions**: Vary by location, time, and regulations.
- **Weather Impact**: Rain, snow, and storms influence travel behavior.
- **Time of Day & Day of the Week**: Movement patterns tied to work and social schedules.

- Which trip purposes are most and least beneficial?
- How does pricing influence customer retention and tipping?
- What insights can be drawn from peak hours?
- How do weather and traffic affect demand?
- Are customers likely to return?
- Which days and times offer the highest revenue potential?
- How do different payment methods impact revenue?
- Can driver and vendor effectiveness be evaluated?

## Aim and Objectives
This analysis aims to conduct a revenue analysis to identify key influences on taxi revenue and provide data-driven insights to optimize operational efficiency, boost revenue, and maximize profitability.

## Tools and Method
### Tools:
- **Power Query**: Imported the data through Power Query, transformed and restructured data for modelling to optimize performance speed.
- **DAX**: Employed DAX functionalities to create a new table and calculate specific measures for key metrics and custom visuals.
- **Power BI**: Used to build the interactive dashboard.

### Method:
- **Data Processing**: Performed necessary transformation steps and ensured datatype consistency in key metric values. Performed data modeling to enhance speed performance and easily access or retrieve specific data.
- **Data Visualization**: Built a 4-page interactive dashboard targeted at answering key requirements and properly communicating findings through customized visuals.

## Result / Dashboard
### Dashboard 1: Trip Patterns and Customer Behavior

### Dashboard 2: Weather and Traffic Impact

### Dashboard 3: Hourly Revenue and Tipping Trends

## Observation / Analysis
Detailed observations of location-based revenue trends, trip purposes, tipping behavior, passenger distribution, pricing impacts, weather and traffic analysis, and weekday/weekend behaviors. (Content added in previous updates.)

## Recommendations
Strategic, data-driven suggestions for:
- Improving low-performing areas (e.g., Suburbs)
- Leveraging high revenue locations (e.g., Uptown)
- Optimizing pricing and tipping opportunities
- Enhancing peak-hour operations
- Tailoring marketing based on trip purposes and weather patterns
- Encouraging digital payment adoption
- Strengthening weekday and weekend strategies

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis of the taxi organization's operations uncovered multiple key insights into revenue drivers. Location plays a significant role, with Uptown and Midtown leading in trip frequency, while Suburbs lag behind despite longer distances.

Traffic, weather, and peak hours all significantly influence ride demand and pricing. With digital payment trends on the rise and strategic marketing aligned to customer behavior, the taxi organization can refine its operations, allocate resources wisely, and maximize revenue growth moving forward.
